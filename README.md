## Overview

### The challenge

The [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK) was to build out this Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Submit their email address using an `input` field.
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    - The `input` field is empty.
    - The email address is not formatted correctly.
